853,Riding the Rails,"Riding the Rails offers a visionary perspective on the presumed romanticism of the road and cautionary legacy of the Great Depression. From 'middle class gentility to scrabble-ass poor,' the undiscriminating Great Depression forced 4,000,000 Americans away from their homes and onto the tracks in search of food and lodging. Of this number, a disturbing 250,000 of the transients were children. The filmmakers relay the experiences and painful recollections of these now-elderly survivors of the rails. Forced to travel more by economic necessity than the spirit of adventure, the film's subjects dispel romantic myths of a hobo existence and its corresponding veneer of freedom. Riding the Rails recounts the hoboes' trade secrets for survival and accounts of dank miseries, loneliness, imprisonment, death, and dispossession. Sixty years later, the filmmakers transport their subjects back to the tracks, where the surging impact of sound and movement resuscitates memories of a shattered adolescence and devastating rite of passage.::Rebecca Yeldham, Sundance Film Festival Programmer"

1421,The Battle of the Broomsticks,"""Onward, ever striving onward, Proudly on our brooms we fly. Straight and true above the treetops Shadows on the moonlit sky."" The strains of the school song can be heard echoing through the vaulted halls of the converted Gothic castle, which is Cackle's Academy. The young witches fly in on their broomsticks across the dark wooded slopes and over the school gates for the start of another year. Miss Hardbroom is taking a register of the first years as they arrive. She is very pleased to see Ethel Hallow come flying in and make a perfect landing, but has to inform Miss Cackle that Mildred Hubble hasn't yet arrived. Miss Cackle wonders if Walker's Gate can be left open a little longer, but Hardbroom is a stickler for discipline and insists that it be closed on time. Mildred Hubble arrives breathless, at the other side of the gate. As she searches for the handle the door slams shut and the key is turned. Mildred is about to call out, but stops herself in time as she reads the notice on the door - ""Latecomers will report to the back entrance where they will stand and wait until they are dealt with by me."" signed C. Hardbroom. Inside the courtyard, Miss Cackle is making a speech of welcome to the girls. At that moment Mildred, in full flight, dangling dangerously from her broomstick, rises up over the gates. Miss Cackle, Miss Hardbroom and the new girls watch, transfixed, as Mildred hanging on for dear life dives down, swoops along the courtyard and crashes straight into the school dustbins, breaking her broomstick in half. Mildred hasn't gotten off to a good start. Everyone has a laugh at her expense, but Maud Moonshine comes to her rescue with some parcel tape. Mildred's broomstick will never fly perfectly again. The next few days are full of madness and mystery as Mildred comes to terms with all the rules and age-old traditions of Cackle's Academy. What an odd place it is! There is no electricity in the school, there are bats in her bedroom, and a cold north wind whistles through twelve-inch thick ever-open glass-free windows. The first two weeks are devoted to broomstick flying. If you don't make the grade, you don't stay for the course. After all, who's ever heard of a witch who can't fly a broomstick?

Mahendranath happily hands over all his property to ""Rajen"" and is promptly murdered by Prem. ""Rajen"" himself is bumped off later.Things get more complicated with new twists and thrills at every turn. Someone is sending Dilip threatening letters about Mahendranath's murder.

But one day, Cupid's arrow unexpectedly strikes Joong-pil's heart who before had nothing to worry about and fear. It's Min-hee, the prettiest girl of the neighborhood girls high school, Jeonglan. But not long before his pink puppy love starts, his cozy life becomes threatened by a newcomer. One day, Joong-pil hears that a transfer student named Sang-man suddenly appeared like a gushing storm and wants to take over the school. Not only the students, but even his righthand man Soo-dong try to incite a fight between Joong-pil and Sang-man, which would become a legend in itself. But strangely enough, Joong-pil seems to avoid getting into a fight with Sang-man. But two kings can't exist in one land, and the showdown draws closer. Meanwhile, the leader of the ""Five Princesses Gang"", Na-young, who has a big crush on Joong-pil finds out that Min-hee is close to him and threatens her by all means. But instead of being the model student Na-young thought she was, Na-young realizes that she has a strong rival on her hands when Min-hee shows off her undaunted attitude. She learns that she's the best student and worst troublemaker of Jeonglan Girls High School. Two different girls who became rivals over the same guy start to compete for Joong-pil's heart in their own way. As time goes by, the situation gets worse as Dan-gun's gang sides with Sang-man. Joong-pil realizes he's in a tight spot. In the meantime, Na-young who has a grueling fight with Sang-man to protect Joong-pil fails drastically and comes back almost half-alive. Now, the fight against Sang-man to determine the strongest fighter at Munduk High School seems inevitable. At last, the countdown to the final fight begins as Joong-pil fights to hold his throne.::Anonymous"

3059,Kundalini Yoga with Gurmukh,"If you, like most Western practitioners, are familiar primarily with the hatha style of yoga, this tape will be a revelation. Kundalini yoga, as instructed here by the Sikh teacher Gurmukh, is very different from hatha. Where the latter moves slowly and deliberately, holding poses so as to achieve maximum depth, concentration, and release, kundalini is built on series of rapid, repeated movements--leg and arm lifts, lateral, forward, and back bends, back rolls, even kicking and punching actions--and has a much more aerobic feel. Indeed, one sequence of deep-knee bends (in the ""Energize"" section) resembles calisthenics, while the ""Strengthen"" section features fast punches and jumps not unlike martial arts training, with Gurmukh, as she does throughout the tape, constantly urging you to go faster. By the time you've completed all four sections of this hour-long tape (""Energize"" and ""Strengthen"" are preceded by ""Awaken"" and followed by ""Relax""), you'll have had a good time and a serious workout. It's good to ""sweat and laugh"" every day, says Gurmukh, and this tape delivers. One caveat: some of these short, quick moves will tend to tighten your muscles, not stretch them. A few hatha-style stretches may be in order when you're done.::Kelly Welldon"

3503,Sumo East and West,"""Sumo East and West"" is a feature documentary about the cultural changes facing Japan as more and more foreigners enter the ancient Japanese sport of sumo wrestling. In Japan sumo is not only the national sport but a centuries-old cultural treasure. Yet this highly traditional world is facing profound changes due to the postwar influx of foreign images, ideas, and influences-foremost among them the arrival of bigger, heavier American wrestlers of Polynesian descent from Hawaii. At the same time, sumo is growing in popularity in the West, where its advocates are lobbying for its inclusion in the Olympics and staging amateur sumo tournaments in venues like Las Vegas casinos-events that bear little resemblance to the sport's Japanese forebear. ""Sumo East and West"" takes us into this world through the story of Wayne Vierra of Hawaii, whose promising professional sumo career in Japan was cut short by injury, but who rebounded to become a champion in the burgeoning world of amateur sumo. The film also features the Hawaii-born superstars of pro sumo who were at the forefront of the controversial transformation of the sport: Konishiki, Jesse ""Takamiyama"" Kuhaulua, and Akebono (the first non-Japanese sumo wrestler to reach the exalted rank of Yokozuna, or Grand Champion). Also featured in the film is Emmanuel Yarbrough of New Jersey, the 750 pound 1995 World Amateur Sumo Champion; and Judge Katsugo Miho of Hawaii, a lifelong sumo aficionado who negotiated the contracts for the Hawaii wrestlers who went to Japan.::Sumo East and West official website"

It begins a half-century earlier at London's Imperial College of Science where Wells meets Jane Robbins, a scientist equally fascinated by unnatural phenomenon, and a woman who immediately captures Wells' heart. Through midnight experiments and secret investigations into the paranormal, through the follies of chance and the miracles of fate, Wells and Robbins find themselves slipping into whirlpools of time, both past and present, they never thought possible. Since this mysterious universe can not be shared with the world, this becomes a wondrous secret that binds them forever. To Wells' surprise, Ellen accepts his outlandish tales of traveling through time. For she is not, she admits, a journalist, but rather an underground government agent who has inherited a puzzling artifact that only Wells could possibly identify: a crystalline orb said to contain the mysteries of the universe, our relationships to other planets, and our past encounters with them.

4057,Ghost Town: The Movie,"Dean Teaster's GHOST TOWN ""The Movie"", is a unique ""Eastern"" Western. It is N.C. native Dean Teaster's tribute to his father Robert Doyle Teaster and ""Ghost Town In The Sky"" theme park. The theme park was a large piece of the childhood happiness for Dean's family and many families since its opening in 1961. This story combines actual family facts of the Teaster family fictionalized into a story that encompasses the best elements of the staged gunfights performed by the Legendary ""Ghost Town Gunfighters"" throughout the years at the park. Many of the original actors have returned for roles in the film. Former ""Ghost Town Gunfighters"" Robert Bradley once known as ""The Apache Kid,"" Herbert Cowboy Coward ""GrandPappy,"" and Harry Valentine ""The Golden Voice of Ghost Town"" play pivotal roles in the film as does Alaska Presley who was one of the original park founders. Dean Teaster reprises the role of ""Digger"" made famous by his father. This movie was created to offset many of the ""Hillbilly"" stereotypes often depicted with this area. The movie paints a picture of this beautiful mountain region that was settled by the overseas Celtic people. These settlers were full of rich traditions and a true grit that allowed them to survive and thrive during the rugged 1800's period of US History often shown in western films. This movie may well be the birth of a sub genre of the western known as ""The Eastern."" With a slight romantic edge this movie is chalked full of messages about love, hate, family, forgiveness, redemption and sacrifice. This film builds on a regional theme where conflict was often fought over family honor versus land as often depicted in westerns due to the gold rushes and land acquisitions and expansions. Being a lover of the western genre I think that we have told a story that will entertain many generations of people and with the re-opening of the ""Ghost Town In The Sky"" theme park we look forward to bright future built upon the past.::By DJ Perry, Screenwriter ""Ghost Town the movie"""

Fact based movie stars Forest Whitaker and Ossie Davis, the former as the founder of the Deacons of Defense and Justice (DDJ) and the latter as a peaceful minister trying to prevent the unavoidable violence that will follow.

Over 60 interviews with Warhol's close friends, collaborators, Superstars, Factory cohorts and family, as well as distinguished philosophers, art historians and cultural commentators, constitute a documentary profile unprecedented in its depth, range and scale. The series boasts unique access to the Warhol Foundation's rich and extensive archives, previously unseen private home-movie footage, audio-tapes as yet unheard, and extracts from Warhol's legendary film experiments, mysteriously withdrawn by the artist over 30 years ago. Warhol's intuitive grasp of, and influence on, the collapsing of high and low culture in the late twentieth century is reflected in the extraordinary range of participants in this series, who include ARTHUR DANTO, Professor of Philosophy at Columbia University, Blondie's DEBBIE HARRY, Hollywood maverick DENNIS HOPPER and fellow Warhol collector LORD ARCHER. Other contributors include artists JULIAN SCHNABEL, JEFF KOONS, PETER BLAKE, KENNY SCHARF, RONNIE CUTRONE and KOMAR and MELAMID; actors CRISPIN GLOVER, JOE DALLESANDRO, UDO KIER and JARED HARRIS; filmmakers PAUL MORRISSEY and JONAS MEKAS; musicians JOHN CALE and THE DANDY WARHOLS; New York socialite NAN KEMPNER, and guru of window dressing, SIMON DOONAN. Beginning with Warhol's death and the establishment of the Andy Warhol museum in Pittsburgh (the only museum dedicated to an American artist), it becomes immediately apparent as we sift through the vast treasure of archives that whether Warhol was sketching, painting, screen printing, photographing, filming, writing, publishing, tape recording, videotaping, or speaking on the telephone, that his entire life was his work, and that as an artist he was obsessed with documenting experience."

The Ra is launched in the twilight days of the war, and shortly after the bombing of Hiroshima the Ra encounters the American battlesub Liberty, whose crew has been tricked into fighting the Ra by Annette's former partner and friend Avatar, whose appraisal of the human race is much more negative than her counterpart. Annette stops Avatar with a blast of mental energy, but the Ra and Liberty destroy each other. Annette and the Ra's first officer are the only survivors. Fifty years later, an unaged Annette and the grandson of the Ra's captain, Go Arisake, are part of a UN team sent to investigate microwaves being generated at the South Pole.

Underestimates the average viewer with narrative entertainment facility that most elementary aspire. Disbelieve the claims of aesthetic styles and trends to contemporary cinema. He denies that which is different from the canon and official discourse. We need an auteur cinema, lack the voice generational dialogue with oxygenated and art that does not represent us. There are few spaces that support the production of new filmmakers. Caballos tries to reflect from the provocation. Its greatest strength lies in the exploration of form and expression. The function of art will always be destabilizing, but with an artistic arsenal. I think this film could be a revealing document of our time.

The girls who make up the assassination unit within the Social Welfare agency are Henrietta, Triela, Claes, Rico and Angelica, all whom have shady backgrounds which led to their involvement with the agency. Each girl is skilled in martial arts, weapons and tactics, demolitions, foreign languages, espionage and counter-terrorism, skills that are necessary when dealing with terrorism, illegal arms deals or even crime organizations who have a serious stranglehold on the country of Europe. But while these girls are the perfect weapons against these types of everyday problems, they must constantly do their best to hold on to what little pieces of their humanity they have left, as they are being forced to commit cold-blooded murder, sometimes even killing innocent people who get in the way. Jose, Henrietta's handler doesn't like the way she and the other girls are being treated as tools for massacre and it pains him everyday to see Henrietta and her friends having to go through this type of life. But if Henrietta and the others want to live to see tomorrow, they have to play the guinea pigs and earn their keep, by getting their hands dirty for the Social Welfare agency, who is responsible for giving them their second chance at life. Because if they don't play by the agency's rules...they will die.::Keno Reeves (spywatcher459)"

What caused Swissair Flight 111 to plunge into waters off the coast of Nova Scotia on September 2, 1998, killing all 229 people aboard? After four years and almost $40 million, investigators revealed that the accident was caused by factors that, alarmingly, still exist on many planes today. NOVA was given unprecedented access to this intricate investigation, involving a seemingly hopeless search for evidence among two million pieces of debris scattered across the ocean floor. The recovery of the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder raised hopes until both were found to have failed during the last six minutes of the flight. Despite these daunting challenges, crash detectives methodically collected, sifted, and sorted through the wreckage to reassemble a large portion of the plane in a giant hangar, building a detailed picture of Flight 111's last moments. After years of painstaking recovery, reconstruction, and testing, the investigators submitted their conclusions and recommended new safety measures. But some experts still believe that another disaster like this one could be just a matter of time.::Imrahil2001"

However the suburbs quickly evolved into a merely a place to live that had neither the benefits of rural or urban life, and where one was reliant on an automobile both to travel elsewhere and even travel within the neighborhood. The suburbs are not only dependent upon cheap energy, but also reliable energy. The reliability of energy is becoming less so as demonstrated by the multi-day blackout of the North American Eastern Seaboard starting on August 14, 2003. Part of the problem of getting out of the suburban mentality is that a generation has grown up believing it to be a normal way of life, and a life of entitlement, which they will not give up without a fight. But many developers and planners and some of the general public understand the want and need to make the way the collective we live in a more walkable and humanistic manner.::Huggo"

His thought was born in the hole of solitary confinement, apart from time and beyond the grasp of society. In his cell, he created his own world and speaks his own language: he has concluded that there is only the mind. This DVD will relinquish to you the extreme story of the killer of all killers: Charles Manson. From convincing his followers to move into the desert to train for the apocalypse, to leading a murderous crew through a string of devilish murders, you will see and hear from Manson himself of how he created a preconceived terror based on his philosophy of life. Manson claims that the so-called 'straight' world outside of prison is but an inverted reflection of the underworld in which he has lived. To him, the reality that presidents and law-abiding citizens accept begins in the hermetic alternate universe of criminals, cons and outlaws. Much as simplistic historians have dismissed Hitler's 3rd Reich as the overcompensation of a failed artist, Manson's vision of a holy war has been generally categorized as nothing more than the jealous rage of a spurned musician.::Clint Weiler"

The Eagles had star quarterback Donovan McNabb to lead the team, opposite star Patriot quarterback Tom Brady. The Patriots were seven-point favorites and had won fourteen of sixteen regular-season games, based in large part on the running of new fullback Corey Dillon, acquired from the Cincinatti Bengals in the off-season. The Eagles, meanwhile, had made their own big-name free-agent acquisition in wide receiver Terrell Owens from the San Francisco Forty-Niners; the Eagles' new receiver was as famous for his flashy behavior and penchant for speaking out to anyone as for his play on the field. Thanks to him, McNabb, and running back Brian Westbrook, the Eagles won 13 games, the most in franchise history. The Patriots' new fullback was long judged to be a source of trouble in Cincinatti, a view that changed as the 2004 season went on. The Eagles had climbed a major mountain, winning the NFC Championship after three consecutive losses in the conference's title game, while the Patriots had defeated the heavily-favored Indianapolis Colts with the league's strongest offense and the 15-1 Pittsburgh Steelers with the league's strongest defense and running game in AFC playoff action, thus setting the stage for a long-awaited showdown between the two most capable teams of the league in the first half of the 2000 decade.::Michael Daly"
